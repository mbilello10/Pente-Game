Type "make" (just that, by itself) to build this project.

For this assignment you will make a working clone of Pente,
which is a board game similar to Tic Tac Toe, except the
goal is to make five in a row. (Pente is Greek for five.)

This game supports 0 players (AI vs AI), 1 player (AI vs
human), and 2 players (human vs. human).

The game works like this:
1) White makes the first move, and must take the center spot.
2) Black can place a black token on any space on the map. 
3) Play then alternates between white and black.
4) If either side gets five in a row (or more) they win
5) If the whole board is filled up, it is a draw
6) There is a capture rule - if you make a move, and it 
surrounds exactly two enemy pieces with another one of
your pieces, then the two enemy pieces are removed.
Example: __WWBB__ would result in a capture for black if
black placed a tile here _BWWBB__, removing the two white
pieces, leaving the row looking like this: _B__BB___.
7) If one side captures a total of 10 pieces (i.e. five
captures total) they win the game immediately.

If white wins, it prints:
WHITE, A WINNER IS YOU!

If black wins, it prints:
BLACK, A WINNER IS YOU!

If the board fills up without a win, it prints:
DRAW!

The main loop is written for you and working correctly -
don't change it unless you have a good reason to do so.
For the basic assignment, search in main.cc for all lines
marked "YOU" (you can use the / key followed by YOU and 
the enter key in Vim to find all such instances, use 'n'
to find the next instance of it). 

There are 10 points available for the basic assignment:

1) Write a working draw detector. A draw takes place when
the whole board is full of pieces. Or to put it another
way, your function will return false (i.e. no draw) if 
any space on the board is open. True otherwise. (3 points)

2) Write a working win detector. A win takes place when 
a move results in five in a row of that color. It can be
horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. Your function will take
an x and y location of the most recent move, and return true
if it resulted in a five in a row, or false otherwise.(5 points)

3) Write a working capture detector. A capture takes place
when the most recent move flanks EXACTLY two pieces of the
enemy color with a friendly piece on the other side. You 
must remove the two enemy pieces, and add two to the friendly
player's score. If they hit 10 points, they win the game.
(2 points)

Up to 10 extra credit is available for writing a better AI:

These are found in the files ai1.cc (white player AI) and in
ai2.cc (black player AI). Use "make" to compile your code.

1) Write an AI that wins if it can. In other words, if it has
an open spot next to four in a row, it will win. Also, if it
has three in a row, with open space on either side, it will 
make a four in a row. (1 point)

2) Write an AI that blocks the human if it can. In other words,
if the human has four in a row with an open space next to it,
it will block the open space. If the human has three in a row,
with two open spaces, it will block one of the open spaces.
If you do both #1 and #2, it should prioritize a win if it has
the option to both go for a win and for a block. (1 point)

3) Write an AI that captures human pieces if it can. In other
words, if it has a piece next to two human pieces, and an 
open spot on the other side of the human pieces, it will
go for the capture. (1 point)

4) If we get enough entries, we will have an AI competition,
and up to 7 extra credit points will be given to each entrant
based on how well they do playing each other. Make sure your
AI has both a white (ai1.cc) and black (ai2.cc) player mode.

NOTE: AI has to follow all the rules for the game (no cheating).
(Humans, too, for that matter.)
